# Advent of Code
My Personal solutions to Advent of Code using Python

All Vanilla python with no required installed modules

Simple and easy to read (although not entirely the fastest)

Using Python 3.6, typing `python3 main.py` will run all answers using the relative input text file. (day 1 used input1.txt etc.). Text files likes input5.2.txt are just the example given in the question on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

### To Do
- Add the ability to run only a certain day
- Maybe speed up some code, current total run time for me is about 2.3 seconds

### Thanks to
Micah Waring gave some speedy code to day 1 part 2
