# Advent of Code
My Personal solutions to Advent of Code using Python

All Vanilla python with no required installed modules

Simple and easy to read (although not entirely the fastest)

### Usage

Using Python 3.6, typing `python3 main.py` will run all answers using the relative input text file. (day 1 used input1.txt etc.). Text files likes input5.2.txt are just the example given in the question on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Usage `-d` for the day you want, `-p` for the part. Leave empty to run all e.g. `python3 main.py` will just run all days. 
For example, `python3 main.py -d 5 -p 1` will run day 1, part 1.

### To Do
- ~~Add the ability to run only a certain day~~
- Maybe speed up some code, current total run time for me is about 2.3 seconds

### Thanks to
Micah Waring gave some speedy code to day 1 part 2
